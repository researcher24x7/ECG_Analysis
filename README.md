ECG Image Classification
Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the term given to the understanding and the tracking of the personâ€™s heart activity using electrical signals.  In this work, we are presenting a convolutional neural network-based model to classify the heartbeat of a person into one of five categories. The proposed model has been trained on the dataset picked from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset. To overcome the imbalance, the dataset was resampled such that there were 100000 examples now in total with each class having an equal number of training examples. After evaluating the arrhythmia classifier on 20000 images that the Model hadn't seen before we got a satisfactory result with a validation accuracy of 98.19.
